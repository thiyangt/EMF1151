# Why are these skills important to learn?

## In 2022, a government in a country introduced a forest conservation tax. The main purpose of the tax is to charge for activities like logging, land clearing, and timber exports to discourage unsustainable use of forests.

### Manager B

Using satellite images, we compared the extent of deforested areas before and after the tax policy was introduced. The data show that these deforested areas have decreased.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)
# Create example data
deforest_data <- data.frame(
  Year = factor(2020:2024),
  Deforested_Area = c(110000, 130000, 140000, 70000, 20000)
)

# Plot bar chart
ggplot(deforest_data, aes(x = Year, y = Deforested_Area)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "sienna3") +  # brown color for deforestation
  labs(
    title = "Reduction in Deforested Areas (2020–2024)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Deforested Area (hectares)"
  ) +
 theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 16),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14)
  )

# Why Statistics are Needed for Managers

1.  To make informed decisions with strong evidence

    -   Statistics helps managers move from “I think” to “I know based on data.”

    -   Statistics gives managers the language of evidence which is important when communicating with policymakers, donors, or communities.

2.  To measure performance and impact

3.  To understand trends and patterns

Obesity is a common problem in captive elephants. Body weight (in kilograms) is a useful way to check their physical condition, but it is hard to weigh elephants.

Therefore, **a team of researchers wants to develop a model to predict body weight (kg)** using four other body measurements of elephants.

## Primary Data vs Secondary Data

1.  **Primary Data:** Data collected directly by the researcher for a specific purpose or study.

2.  **Secondary Data:** Data that has already been collected by someone else and made readily available for researchers to use

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Primary Data Collection Methods

1.  Observational studies

2.  Questionnaire Survey

Method: Asking a set of questions

Instruments:

-   Printed or digital questionnaires

-   Google Forms / [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)

-   Mobile apps or data collection tools (e.g., [KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/))

**Your turn:** Find other primary data collection methods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your turn

Identify secondary data sources relevant to forestry and environmental sciences.

-   Open source data repositories:

    [ourworldindata](https://ourworldindata.org/)

-   Paid data repositories

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your turn

Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Agriculture recently conducted a census of crop-damaging animals. The counts of toque macaques, monkeys, giant squirrels, and peacocks were recorded. The next step is to enter the collected data into an Excel spreadsheet for effective analysis.

Suppose you are responsible for creating an Excel sheet for data entry and establishing clear guidelines for data entry operators.

**Prepare a concise guideline document that includes the following:**

-   A rough sketch of the Excel sheet layout

-   Guidelines on:

    -   Handling missing observations
    -   Dealing with unreadable handwritten responses from the census forms.
    -   Any other important rules to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
